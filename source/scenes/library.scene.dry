The German Republic, called by some of our detractors as the "Weimar Republic", is a parliamentary republic with a somewhat weak president and a strong parliament, called the Reichstag. The Reichstag is responsible for governing, while the President has a largely ceremonial role but also has some important governing responsibilities.

The Reichstag is elected based on a proportional representation system, giving parties seats roughly proportional to their vote share in each electoral district. The Reichstag then elects the Chancellor and the cabinet by a majority vote, who are responsible for government. A majority vote-of-no-confidence can remove the current government.

The President is elected by a national direct vote, in two rounds. The second round is used if the first round does not result in a majority for one candidate; the candidate who receives a plurality in the second round becomes president (there is no obligation for weaker candidates to drop out). The role of the president is mostly to represent Germany, but he also has some crucial governing powers. The president and chancellor can together use emergency decrees to govern, bypassing the Reichstag. The president can also appoint or remove a chancellor when a parliamentary majority is unable to be established, and can thus influence the formation of a government.

Germany is divided into a number of states, each of which have their own governments with some responsibilities. By far the largest and most important state is Prussia.

= Timeline of the SPD and the Republic (until 2021)

**1949**: The Federal Republic of Germany is founded. The Social Democratic Party of Germany, reconstituted after the Nazi period, becomes the main opposition to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of the CDU. In the Soviet occupation zone, the SPD had been forcibly merged with the KPD into the SED.

**1959**: The SPD adopts the Godesberg Program, abandoning its Marxist orientation and redefining itself as a broad-based “people’s party” committed to the social market economy, NATO membership, and parliamentary democracy.

**1966**: A Grand Coalition is formed between the CDU/CSU and SPD. SPD leader Willy Brandt becomes Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister.

**1969**: The SPD forms a coalition with the FDP. Willy Brandt becomes Chancellor, leading a reform-oriented government. Brandt launches Ostpolitik, normalizing relations with Eastern Europe and the German Democratic Republic.

**1972**: Brandt wins reelection after a failed vote of no confidence. The Basic Treaty with East Germany is signed, easing tensions between the two German states.

**1974**: Brandt resigns following the Guillaume spy affair. Helmut Schmidt becomes Chancellor. The SPD governs during economic turbulence and domestic terrorism by the Red Army Faction.

**1982**: The FDP switches coalition partners. Helmut Schmidt is removed via constructive vote of no confidence, and Helmut Kohl becomes Chancellor. The SPD returns to opposition.

**1989–1990**: The Berlin Wall falls and German reunification follows. The Federal Republic annexes the former German Democratic Republic. The East German SPD merges with the West German SPD.

**1998**: The SPD, led by Gerhard Schröder, wins federal elections and forms a coalition with the Greens. Schröder becomes Chancellor.

**2003**: The Schröder government launches Agenda 2010 and the Hartz labor market reforms, restructuring welfare and unemployment benefits. The reforms are controversial within the SPD and among trade unions. Schröder joins French President Chirac in preventing a consensus that would allow Operation Iraqi Freedom to become a NATO operation, arguing instead for continued diplomacy and weapons inspections.

**2005**: Leftist dissidents opposed to the SPD's neoliberal policies split to form the WASG. After early elections, the SPD enters a Grand Coalition with the CDU under Angela Merkel. Schröder leaves federal politics.

**2007**: Germany assumes presidency of the G8 for the year and presidency of the Council of the European Union for six months. The left-wing PDS and WASG merge to form Die Linke.

**2009**: The SPD suffers significant electoral losses and returns to opposition. The CDU and FDP form a coalition government, allowing Merkel to remain chancellor.

**2013**: Following federal elections, the SPD once again enters a Grand Coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel after a membership referendum approves the coalition agreement. The AfD is founded as a Eurosceptic party opposing Eurozone bailouts.

**2015**: Escalating civil wars in North Africa and the Middle East caused around two million people to seek refuge in Europe. Merkel unilaterally decide to welcome a large portion into Germany, causing around 400k Syrians to flee to Germany.

**2017**: The SPD records its worst postwar federal election result. After initial refusal, it reenters a Grand Coalition under Merkel. The far-right AfD entered the Bundestag for the first time.

**2019**: Internal dissatisfaction grows within the party over coalition compromises and electoral decline. A new leadership duo, Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, is elected, signaling a shift toward the party’s left wing.

**2020**: The COVID-19 pandemic causes several German states to impose harsh lockdowns. The SPD supports expansive fiscal measures within Merkel’s coalition government, earning goodwill for Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz.

**Demographic Groups**

**Working Class**: The urban working class - blue-collar workers in factories, workshops, mines, and the like. Most are socialist, supporting either the SPD or Die Linke. They make up 40-50% of the population.

**Old Mittelstand**: The old middle class consists of independent artisans, shopkeepers, and small-time businesspeople. They tend to be conservative and are the strongest base for the far right. Less than 10% of the population.

**New Mittelstand**: The new middle class consists of white-collar workers and government employees. This is the base of liberalism. Around 20% of the population.

**Rural**: Small and large farmers and independent rural workers. Mostly concerned with the survival of the coal industry and rural digitization. 10-15% of the population.

**Catholics** are the largest religious minority, at about 25% of the population. They disproportionately support the Christian Democratic Union (or the Christian Social Union in Bavaria).

**Muslims** account for between 6.4% to 6.7% of the population, and ironically tend to support the conservative CDU, although substantial numbers support the SPD or Greens.

**SPD** - *Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands* (Social Democratic Party of Germany) - this is us. We are a socialist and democratic party of the working class. We are the heirs of the legacy of Brandt and Schröder. We are the foremost defenders of the Republic. The modern SPD was formed from a merger of the West and East German branches of the SPD in 1990. Save for a period between 2009 to 2013, we have always been part of a governing coalition for the course of the 21st century.

Internal dissent: [+ dissent_percent : dissent +]

**CDU** - *Christlich Demokratische Union* (Christian Democratic Union) - a centrist to center-right Christian conservative party that supports the Republic, and has been historically responsible for watering down many of our labor, welfare, and environmentalist schemes. They have often been in coalitions with us. They are in a political alliance with the **CSU** (Christian Social Union), which represents Christian democrats in Bavaria. They have governed for sixteen long years under Angela Merkel.

Current relations: [+ cdu_relation : relationships +]

# TODO: replace this with the german state party after 1930
**FDP** - *Freie Demokratische Partei* (Free Democratic Party) - a liberal party, popular among the intelligensia and educated middle class.

Current relations: [+ fdp_relation : relationships +]

**Greens** - *Bündnis 90/Die Grünen* (Alliance 90/The Greens) - a center-left green political party formed in 1993, deriving much of its support from West Germany. They are our preferred coalition partners.

Current relations: [+ linke_relation : relationships +]

[? if bsw_formed: **BSW** - *Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht* (Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance) - a party recently formed in a split from Die Linke, the BSW is essentially an agglomeration of various left-wing political beliefs with populist and nationalist tendencies. ?]

**AfD** - *Alternative für Deutschland* (Alternative for Germany, or Neo-Nazis) - a far-right nationalist and Eurosceptic party. Founded by Alexander Gauland in 2013, they have since been employing historical revisionism as well as xenophobic rhetoric.

Current relations: [+ afd_relation : relationships +]

**Other parties** - there is a multitude of small parties, located all throughout the political spectrum. These range from the right-wing Volt Party to various environmentalist and animal rights groups that refuse to caucus with the Greens. [? if chancellor != "Merkel": The most significant of these is the socially liberal South Schleswig Voters' Association (SSW), which is a party for the national Danish minority in Southern Schleswig. ?]
