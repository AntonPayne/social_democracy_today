= Russo-Ukranian War

The conflict in Ukraine that had been static since 2014 erupted once again after Russian divisions began an incursion into Ukrainian-administered territory. Ukrainian forces are in retreat, with heavy fighting being reported in major Ukrainian cities.

Vladimir Putin claims that the Russian invasion was in response to rising Ukrainian neo-Nazism and NATO expansion. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy claims that he is willing to do anything to defend his country, despite initial electoral promises of ending the Donbass War.

As we are part of the current government, we are expected to provide a response to this sudden invasion.

[? if foreign_minister_party != "SPD" and foreign_minister != "Trittin" : Foreign Minister [+ foreign_minister +] spoke about Germanyâ€™s solidarity with Ukraine and European security in their latest speech It is up to us on how to react to it. ?]
[? if foreign_minister_party = "Greens" and foreign_minister = "Trittin" : Foreign Minister [+ foreign_minister +] has opposed arms deliveries to Ukraine and emphasized the importance of diplomacy in resolving conflicts. ?]
[? if foreign_minister_party = "SPD" : As we control the foreign ministry, we are expected to voice our opinions on this conflict. ?]
