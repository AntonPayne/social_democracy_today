Since we are currently ruling as part of an emergency government, we may use quasi-constitutional trickery to significantly delay these elections, and continue governing via Article 48. This is likely to be extremely unpopular both with our base and with the other parties. However, this may be necessary to prevent the extremists from gaining power.

- @cancel_elections_2: Yes, do it.
- @election_algorithm: No, let's hold the elections.

In response to the KPD's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that the Popular Front government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and center and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The KPD has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" within the Popular Front government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side. They seem to expect that the Popular Front would inevitably fail, and that our failure would benefit them.

In response to the KPD's entrance into the government, the right-wing immediately launches a coup attempt. Troops of the Stahlhelm and Nazi SA enter Berlin and immediately begin clashing with our supporters! Reactionary officers within the Reichswehr have taken their troops out of the barracks and joined them with the Stahlhelm to stop us from taking power.

The Center manages to diffuse some of the hostility from the Reichswehr and the Stahlhelm, but fail to prevent the outbreak of fighting. We are forced to fight on the same side as the KPD, whether we want to or not.

The reactionary establishment is still very skeptical of the Nazis, so instead, [+ president +] appoints Kurt von Schleicher, a former general, as chancellor, to try to "tame" the Nazis.

Schleicher's government is deeply unpopular among all parties of the Bundestag. Despite his support for a coalition with the NSDAP, the Nazis want power all to themselves, without Schleicher.

@far_right_braun

President Braun faces a dilemma. Is it "democratic" to let democracy be destroyed, if the majority of voters have willed it so? Some, even on the left, suggest that the Nazis would not *truly* be as horrific as their platform suggests, and that giving them power would let them discredit themselves in the eyes of the public.

Alternatively, Braun could use the emergency powers of the presidency. Article 48 has been used by Hindenburg to promulgate anti-democratic and anti-worker policies; can Article 48 be used for good as well as evil?

The Left is still very reluctant to join a coalition, despite grassroots friendliness between our memberships. The Stalinist leadership is vehemently against such a thing.

In response to [+ chancellor +] being appointed Chancellor, the right-wing forces launches almost immediately launch an attempted coup. Troops of the Stahlhelm and Nazi SA enter Berlin and immediately begin clashing with our supporters! Reactionary officers within the Reichswehr have taken their troops out of the barracks and joined them with the Stahlhelm to stop the KPD from taking power.

Somehow, surprisingly, the left coalition is successfully formed, without appointing Wissler as chancellor. The consensus choice for chancellor, accepted by the SPD, Linke, and President [+ president +], is Rolf Mützenich, who was acceptable to the left due to his membership in the Parliamentary Left.

In response to the Left's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that our government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The Left Party has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" in the worker's government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side. They seem to expect that we would inevitably fail, and that our failure would benefit them. 

Whatever their reasoning is, the SPD has control over the ministries of government.

Even though the Greens are very reluctant to participate in such a coalition, they still accede to Armin Laschet's wishes. Thus, a majority center-right coalition is formed, with Laschet as chancellor and Robert Habeck as Vice Chancellor. A fluke ballot fails to attain a majority at first, but intense negotiations allow for a government with the slimmest margin.

There is no path to a majority government. President Hindenburg is tired of the chaos, and appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor instead of Günther. Papen is a indenpendent formerly from the Center Party, and is significantly to the right of the majority of the Center Party.

Papen is immediately faced with a vote of no confidence, given his unpopularity. However the SPD votes, he is guaranteed to fall, due to the unanimous hatred against him from all other parties.

There is no path to a majority government. One option would be to have a continuation of the current Brüning government; if we tolerate it, then it would retain a majority vote against no-confidence.

Alternatively, we could try to form a "new grand coalition" of all constitutional parties except the NSDAP, KPD, and DNVP. The stumbling block are the minor conservative parties such as the "Economic Party of the Middle Class", who detest any hint of socialism and would ruin the country before working with Marxists.

We have enough votes to form a "Germany Coalition" government consisting of the SPD, CDU, and FDP. The voters were tired of grand coalitions. And what do they get in return? The FDP as a dollop of cream on top! At least we can form a stable government...

There are enough votes to form a majority coalition consisting of the SPD, Center (Z), Bavarian People's (BVP), Democratic ([+ ddp_name +]), and People's (DVP) parties. Given our rather weak electoral performance, [? if spd_no_confidence = 1 : and our previous vote of no confidence against the government, ?][? if no_confidence_against_spd = 1 : and the vote of no confidence against us, ?] President Hindenburg has asked the Center Party to take the lead role in forming a government.

# TODO: if the SPD participated in bringing down the previous government via a vote-of-no-confidence, or if we were essentially removed from government by our coalition partners, we should be more reluctant to participate in a new government.

The Center chancellor is likely to be Heinrich Brüning of the Center Party [? if chancellor = "Brüning" : again. ?][? if chancellor != "Brüning": . ?] He is known for his conservatism and sympathy for monarchism, being on the right wing of the Center. [? if austerity >= 2 : Due to the government's austerity policies, many of our members are reluctant to participate in this coalition again.
