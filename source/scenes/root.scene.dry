> "*Because, as Primo Levi, who was born in Turin 100 years ago and who survived Auschwitz as a forced labourer in Monowitz, later wrote: “It happened, therefore it can happen again.” So we cannot close our eyes and ears when people are being verbally abused, humiliated or marginalised. We must confront those who stir up prejudice and incite hatred against people of different faiths or origins.*"

This is a game of future speculation. While realism is a major concern, keep in mind that this is a *game*, and that any divergence from actual events will necessarily have to involve some element of make-believe. Nevertheless, please let the author know if there are any glaring mistakes.
