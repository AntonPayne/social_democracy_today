#subtitle: Building ties with our fraternal socialist parties.

At the Progressive Alliance, we can forge contacts with our fraternal socialist parties in Europe and across the world.

- @fr_sp: Build relationships with the French PS and Spanish PSOE to move their governments in Germany's favor.
- @myanmar: Learn organization and street fighting from the Myanma DPNS.
- @scandi: Learn the path of economics and reform from the Scandinavian social democrats.
- @america: Contact the Trade Union Confederation of the Americas.
- @china: Forget the Progressive Alliance - host a conference with the Chinese communists.
- @return: We do not need international contacts at the moment.

The social democrats of France and Spain could influence their governments to be friendlier with Germany in the future, paving the way for European unity.

Our Reichsbanner can learn much in paramilitary organization and training from the Myanma People's Defence Force, the paramilitary representing the center-left within Myanmar.

[? if myanmar_offensive_seen and not myanmar_civil_war_seen: We are also helping the Democratic Party for a New Society build up their resources in preparation for a future struggle, legally and illegally. ?]

The programs of the Nordic socialists involve active government intervention in the economy. We can learn from their economic strategies, and how they moved beyond their working-class base to attract a broader set of constituents.

We host a conference with the Communist Party of China (CPC) on the history of socialism in China and Germany. This can also help us outflank Die Linke from the left in the future.

[? if year <= 2025: President Joseph Biden is joined by many Western European countries in expressing their  us for meeting with the CPC. ?]
[? if year >= 2025: With Donald Trump leading the United States, many who previously mocked the idea that the 21st century is the "Chinese Century" are now welcoming closer ties with China. ?]

Fred Redmond greatly appreciates our aid and the Trade Union Confederation of the Americas helps us organize strikes. However, the Confederation's past support for various pro-American dictatorships in Latin America angers some of our membership.

@return

We do not need the international contacts at the moment.
